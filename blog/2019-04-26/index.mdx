## I was stuck

I wanted to contribute articles, tools and other content to a community to help others and to help concretize my knowledge

I wanted a place to find great content that gave me deeper tricks and tips into doing my job better

I heard about [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) which I hoped to leverage to make more interactive content

No places that I knew of had a contribution process that would easily allow contributors to include code along with content

Beyond this most tech blog sites these days are full of

- [vacuous fluff articles](https://dev.to/amandathedevnyc/first-rejection-3hda)
- [obvious things unrelated to tech](https://dev.to/tailomateus/prioritize-the-important-things-42h7)
- [secular preaching](https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/16/women-in-tech/)

These things are fine, I guess, but they are not what most engineers care about

We want solutions to our problems

That's it

## So I

I decided to buy [stuck.dev](www.stuck.dev) to fill a need I saw in the industry

The aim is to make a blog with a

- pull request oriented contribution process
  - facilitates already known workflows
  - funnels out the less tech savvy
  - increases ease of publication
- problem -> solution oriented structure
  - that's how our brains work
  - it's what people want
  - it makes contributors carefully consider the reader when writing
- reusable interactive components
  - examples > lengthy explanations
  - many need more than just text to learn, but videos are inefficient
  - through mdx we can easily make components to help facilitate learning
